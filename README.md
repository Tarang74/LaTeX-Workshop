## Recommended Approach for Learning

For the best interactive experience, I recommend compiling the source
code in `main.tex` used to generate `main.pdf`. Use the following steps
to accomplish this:

1. Clone the repository or download all source code using GitHub or git.
2. Open `main.tex` in your LaTeX editor of choice (i.e., VSCode or Overleaf).
3. Compile `main.tex` and read it alongside the compiled PDF document,
   making changes to the source code as you wish.

Note:

- Overleaf users may need to select the XeLaTeX compiler to
support the Unicode character set and Open Type Fonts. This document
uses the XeTeX engine.
- The first time you compile `main.tex` may be significantly slower due
  to large number of inlined code blocks used in this document.
